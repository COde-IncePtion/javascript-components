            <p>An algorithm is defined as a way of instructing the computer to perform a certain operation. It is
                basically
                a series of <strong>step-by-step</strong> instructions required to solve any problems</p>

            <p>It consist of a set of explicit and finite steps which, when carried out for a given set of
                initial conditions, produce the corresponding output and terminate in a fixed amount of time. It is a
                sequence of finite instructions often used for calculations and data processing.

        <h3>Characteristics of Algorithms</h3>
        <ol class="list-styled">
            <li><strong>Finiteness</strong> - The algorithm should have a stop after a certain number of instructions.
                It should terminate after a fixed number of steps.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Input</strong> - A good algorithm should be able to accept a set of defined input before the
                execution of the algorithm begins.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Output</strong> - The algorithm should be able to produce results as output, preferably solution
            </li>
            <li><strong>Definiteness</strong> - Each step of the algorithm is precise i.e., the action carried out
                should be specified clearly and unambiguous.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Effectiveness</strong> - All the operations used in the algorithm are basic and can be performed
                exactly in a fixed duration of time.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Types of Algorithms</h3>
        <ol class="list-styled">
            <li><strong>Brute Force Algorithm</strong> - This is the most basic and simplest type of algorithm. A Brute
                Force Algorithm is the straightforward approach to a problem i.e., the first approach that comes to our
                mind on seeing the problem. More technically it is just like iterating every possibility available to
                solve that problem.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Recursive Algorithm </strong> - This type of algorithm is based on recursion. In recursion, a
                problem is solved by breaking it into subproblems of the same type and calling own self again and again
                until the problem is solved with the help of a base condition.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Divide and Conquer Algorithm</strong> - In Divide and Conquer algorithms, the idea is to solve
                the problem in two sections, the first section divides the problem into subproblems of the same type.
                The second section is to solve the smaller problem independently and then add the combined result to
                produce the final answer to the problem.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Programming Algorithms</strong> - This type of algorithm is also known as the
                memoization technique because in this the idea is to store the previously calculated result to avoid
                calculating it again and again. In Dynamic Programming, divide the complex problem into smaller
                overlapping subproblems and storing the result for future use.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Greedy Algorithm</strong> - In the Greedy Algorithm, the solution is built part by part. The
                decision to choose the next part is done on the basis that it gives the immediate benefit. It never
                considers the choices that had taken previously.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Backtracking Algorithm</strong> - In Backtracking Algorithm, the problem is solved in an
                incremental way i.e. it is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build
                a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the
                constraints of the problem at any point of time.

        <h3>Let's take an example!</h3>
        <p>It is always consider as one of the best ways to give an example while proposing any concept. Therefore, to
            get into the detail of how an algorithm works and its representation, we will take an example of <strong>Binary
                Search.</strong>
        </p>
        <div>
            <h4>Binary Search</h4>
            <p>It is a search algorithm which falls under the category of <strong>divide and conquer</strong>
                algorithms. For
                using this algorithm, the input needs to in a <strong>sorted manner</strong> in accordance with any of
                parameter present
                in the input.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Explanation</strong> - In this algorithm, an element is searched in a sorted array by repeatedly
                dividing the search interval in half.
                Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in
                the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper
                half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.</p>
            <p>Algorithms are generally represented in the form of flow charts. Following is the flowchart for binary
                search.</p>
